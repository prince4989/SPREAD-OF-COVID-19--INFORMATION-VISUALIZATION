# SPREAD-OF-COVID-19--INFORMATION-VISUALIZATION
In current time, when every COVID-19 affected nation is making efforts to mitigate and alleviate the spread of this virus, it becomes essential to study the correlations of the cases of COVID-19 reported per day with respect to behavioural and environmental attributes. 
A long-term prediction of cumulative cases, spreadability rate, pandemic peak of COVID-19 was made for India. Prediction provided by the model considering most recent data is useful for making appropriate interventions to deal with the rapidly emerging pandemic.
